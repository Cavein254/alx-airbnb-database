To monitor and refine database performance based on your schema and query behavior, weâ€™ll follow these steps:

## Step 1: Identify Frequently Used Queries

We'll identify the queries are commonly used:

```sql
-- user booking
SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' ORDER BY start_date DESC;

-- Property listing
SELECT * FROM Property WHERE host_id = 'some-host-id';

-- property reviews
SELECT AVG(rating), COUNT(*) FROM Review WHERE property_id = 'some-property-id';

```

## Step 2: Use `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE` or `SHOW PROFILE`

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

## Step 3: Add Missing Indexes

```sql
-- user bookings
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_startdate ON Booking(user_id, start_date DESC);

-- property listing
CREATE INDEX idx_property_host_id ON Property(host_id);

-- property reviews
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_id ON Review(property_id);
```

## Step 4: Schema Adjustment

If performance remains poor even with indexes, consider:

- Partitioning large tables (e.g., Booking by start_date)
- Sharding messages if volume is very high
- Normalize or denormalize based on access patterns (e.g., store rating aggregates in Property)
